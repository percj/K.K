Liquid Mesh FX
---------------

Thanks for buying Liquid Mesh FX! In the Prefabs folder you'll find a variety of emitter types and different liquids.

You can simply drag and drop prefabs into the scene, or instantiate them with a script.

You are free to reference or re-purpose any of the included scripts for your games or projects.

Scaling Effects
---------------

You can scale the effects in Transform, but note that Gravity settings in the particle systems may need to be adjusted depending on how much you scale the effect. Audio Sources and Point Lights attached to the effect will also have to be adjusted manually.

---------------
Upgrade to URP
---------------

To upgrade to URP, import the package in the Upgrade folder.

Note that in order for the Refractive water shader to work, you need to enable the Opaque Texture in your quality settings.

Also for Soft Particles to work in URP, you'll need to enable Depth Texture in the same quality setting menu.

You can find the SRP settings in 'Edit -> Quality -> Rendering'. Double-click the profile to open it. In the Inspector you can enable Depth Texture and Opaque Texture.
